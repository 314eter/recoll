== Querying Recoll from a C program

The easiest way to query Recoll from a C or C++ program is to execute an
external search command (`recollq` or `recoll -t`).

I have written a simple C module which deals with the related housekeeping
and presents an easy to use API to the rest of the code. You will find it
here:

    https://bitbucket.org/medoc/recoll-capi

It is a bit experimental and will only work with recoll 1.20 for now
(because it uses a new option for recollq). However it would be trivial to
modify for working with 1.19, get in touch with me if you need this.

The other approach is to link with the Recoll library. This has no official
API, but in practise, the internal one is fairly stable, and if you want to
choose this approach, you should start from the code in recollq.cpp
