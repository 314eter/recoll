== Preventing indexing in a directory

=== Why would you want to do this ?

By default, recollindex (or the indexing thread inside the recoll QT user
interface) will process your home directories and most its subdirectories,
at the exception of some well known places (thumbnails, beagle and web
browser caches, etc.) 

You may want to prevent indexing in some directories where you don't expect
interesting search results. This will avoid polluting the search result
lists, speed up indexing times and make the index smaller. 

=== How to do it

There are two ways to block indexing at certain points: either by listing
specific paths, or by directory name pattern matches. 

- Blocking specific paths: this is controlled by the skippedPaths variable
  in the main configuration file. You can adjust the value either by
  editing the file or by using the indexing configuration dialog:
  _Preferences->Indexing configuration->Global parameters->Skipped paths_
- Using pattern matches: these are listed in the skippedNames variable in
  the main configuration file. You can adjust the value either by editing
  the file or by using the GUI: _Preferences->Indexing configuration->Local
  parameters->Skipped names_
