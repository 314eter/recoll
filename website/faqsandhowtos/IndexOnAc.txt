== Laptops: starting or stopping indexing according to AC power status

For people using real time indexing on a laptop, kind user "The Doctor"
contributed a script to automatically start and stop indexing according to
power status. The script can be found here:
link:https://opensourceprojects.eu/p/recoll1/code/ci/144da4a5caa2b39d23d9d7cf262f03b6d80a4739/tree/src/desktop/recoll_index_on_ac.sh[recoll_index_on_ac.sh]

To use it, you need to copy it somewhere (e.g.: '/usr/bin', but any place
will do), make it executable (`chmod a+x recoll_index_on_ac.sh`), and edit
'~/.config/autostart/recollindex.desktop'

Change the following line:

    Exec=recollindex -w 60 -m

to something like the following (depending where you copied the script):

    Exec=/usr/bin/recoll_index_on_ac.sh

You may also want to change
'/usr/share/recoll/examples/recollindex.desktop', otherwise your change
will be reverted the next time you toggle real time indexing through the
GUI. And, yes, sorry about it, _this_ change will be lost on the next
Recoll update, so save a copy.
