== Recoll GUI keyboard navigation

Using Recoll without the mouse is not completely straightforward, but it is
mostly feasible. Here follows a description of the usable shortcuts. 

=== Anywhere

`Ctrl+q` should exit Recoll from anywhere.

=== Main window and result list ===

When Recoll starts up, the focus is in the simple search entry. The main
window tab order is as follows: 

* Clear
* Search
* Search type combo
* Search entry  (Initial focus)
* Result list (scrolling etc)
* Result list 1st link
* Result list next links...
* Back to Clear

Each result list entry has 3 links: the icon link is not active, but its
value is the URL, so that it can be dragged and dropped to another
application. The 2 other links are _Preview_ and _Open_ and can be
activated by typing _Enter_. 

Typing _Ctrl+Shift+s_ anywhere in the main window should return the focus to the search entry. So will _Ctrl+l_ in future versions (for compatibility with WEB browser usage).

For pure keyboard usage, you can improve this by:

- Disabling the icon link: use _Preferences->GUI configuration->Result
  List->Edit result paragraph_ and remove the `<a href='%U'>` and `</a>`
  around the `<img...>` tag. 
- Making the active link more visible by adding the following code to the
  result page HTML header insert (same preferences tab). Feel free to
  adjust the color :=) : 

----
<style type="text/css">
a:focus {background-color: red;}
</style>
----

=== Result table

The same _Ctrl+Shift+s_ will return the focus to the search entry when
working with the result table. 

_Ctrl+r_ will move the focus from the entry to the spreadsheet. When in
there the arrow keys will navigate the lines.  

When a line is selected:

* _Ctrl+o_ will _Open_ the document.
* _Ctrl+Shift+o_ will _Open_ the document and exit Recoll.
* _Ctrl+d_ (detail) will start a _Preview_

_Esc_ will deselect the current line so that mouse hovering will work again.
