== Indexing Outlook archives ==

Recoll has no direct support for indexing Microsoft Outlook data, because,
if you are a Windows user, you probably are not a good customer for Linux
desktop indexing...

However, if you have a need to index Outlook data at some point, I can
recommend the excellent link:http://www.five-ten-sg.com/libpst/[libpst]
library and its link:http://www.five-ten-sg.com/libpst/rn01re01.html[readpst]
utility. Using this you can very easily convert the Outlook data into MH or
mbox format, and then index the result with Recoll.
