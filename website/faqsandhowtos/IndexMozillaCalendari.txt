== Indexing Mozilla calendar data

Mozilla calendar programs (*Sunbird*, *Lightning*) do not store their
data in +ics+ files natively. They use an *SQLite* database (the
'storage.sdb' file inside the profile). This means that calendar data
cannot be indexed directly.  

To get Recoll to index calendar data, you need to export it to an +ics+
file. This can be done manually, from the application menus, or, by
installing the
link:https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/sunbird/addon/3740[Automatic Export
extension]. 

The extension can be configured to export the data when exiting the
program, or at regular time intervals.  You can even set up a command to be
executed after the export. If you are not using real time indexing, this
can usefully be *recollindex*.

In _Tools->Add Ons->Automatic Export preferences_, in the _Start an
application after export_ subpanel, set _Path of application_ to
'/usr/[local/]bin/recollindex' and _Parameters of application_ to
something like _-i;/home/me/path/to/nameofexportedcal.ics_ 

This will ensure that the calendar is indexed every time it is exported
(this is not necessary though, you can let the next batch indexing pass
take care of it). 

It may happen that the exported data has some syntax errors which will
prevent indexing with the *rclics* filter which was distributed up to
Recoll 1.13.04 (included). You may get an updated filter from the
link:https://www.recoll.org/download.html[Recoll download page].
