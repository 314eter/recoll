== Starting native applications ==

Another example of using an intermediary script for an application with a
command line syntax which can't be directly defined in mimeview. 

We use a script to preprocess and adapt the options before calling the
actual command. 

Details about configuring how the native application or script are called
are given with the
link:http://www.recoll.org/usermanual/usermanual.html#RCL.INSTALL.CONFIG.MIMEVIEW[description
of the mimeview configuration file].

*qpdfview* (link:http://launchpad.net/qpdfview[web site]) is a very
lightweight tabbed PDF viewer with great search performance and result
highlighting.

It does support parsing the search term and page number from the command
line with the following syntax:

----
qpdfview --unique "%f"#%p --search "%s"
----

However, qpdfview will not launch if either %p or %s are empty in the
command above. To accommodate for that, Recoll user Florian has written a
small wrapper shell script:

----
#!/bin/bash

qpdfviewpath=qpdfview

if [ -z $2 ]
then
    page=""

else
    page="#"$2""
fi

if [ -z $3 ]
then
    search=""

else
    search="--search "$3""
fi

$qpdfviewpath --unique "$1"$page $search >&0 2>&0 &
----


The corresponding handler line for Recoll would be (depending on how you
name the script and where you store it):

----
      qpdfviewwrapper %f %p %s
----
