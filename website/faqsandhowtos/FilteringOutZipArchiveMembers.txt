== Filtering out Zip archive members ==

The *rclzip* Zip archive extraction input handler does not use the general
configuration variables which define what file system objects should be
skipped, but it has an equivalent internal function. 

The name-skipping code depends on a recent member of the the Recoll Python
package. This will become standard for release 1.20, but for earlier
releases, you need to do two things to use this function: 

- Fetch 'python/recoll/recoll/rclconfig.py' and 'filters/rclzip' from the
  source repository. 
- Copy both to '/usr/share/recoll/filters' and make 'rclzip' executable.

You can then set a variable named +zipSkippedNames+ inside
'recoll.conf'. +zipSkippedNames+ should be a space-separated list of
patterns which will be passed to the Python fnmatch() function. The +/+
characters are not special (matched as any character). 

You can't use embedded spaces in patterns (no double-quote quoting for now)

This can be redefined for file system directories using the usual section
indicators (Zip archives in different file-system directories can have
different skip lists). 

Example:

----
zipSkippedNames = *.txt
[/path/to/the/dir]
zipSkippedNames = somedir/*/*.html
----
