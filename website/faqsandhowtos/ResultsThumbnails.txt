== Result list thumbnails and how to create them

Recoll will display thumbnails for the results if the images exist in the 
standard location ('$HOME/.thumbnails' or '$HOME/.cache/thumbnails' depending
on the xdg version). 

But it will not create thumbnails, mainly because it is very hard to do
portably.

Thumbnails are most commonly created when you visit a directory with your
file manager, but visiting the whole file tree just to create thumbnails is
a bit fastidious.

One simple trick to create thumbnails from the recoll GUI is to visit the
parent directory for a result by using the _Open parent document/folder_
entry in the right-click menu.

You can also find tools for the systematic creation of thumbnails for a
directory tree. Three such tools are discussed on this

Also please note that no thumbnails can currently be generated or displayed
for embedded documents (attachments, archive members, etc.).
